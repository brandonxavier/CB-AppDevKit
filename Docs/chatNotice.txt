cb.chatNotice(message, [to_user], [background], [foreground], [weight])
Send a message to the room. If to_user is given, the message will only be seen by
that user. You can also use the optional params background, foreground, and weight
to style your message. Only HTML color codes (such as #FF0000) may be given for the
color stying, and the font weight will only accept the options normal, bold, or
bolder. If you want to provide styling options, but not a to_user, just pass an
empty string to to_user.

You can use a \n inside the message to send a multi-line notice.

You may use :emoticons in the notice.
